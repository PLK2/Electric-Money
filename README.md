# About

Proof of work may be Bitcoin's most least understood concept. *"Why can't we just change the code to make it more energy friendly?"* The answer to that question is best discovered by the questioner themselves. This website -- https://ElectricMoney.org -- can help them along in that process. **This is a simple, plain-language, first-stop explainer for your normy friends who just don't quite get it.** It falls somewhere between a headline and an academic paper and requires a person simply take the time to click the link and perhaps read just a few short sentences; that may be enough to plant the seed.

The website covers only three questions:
1. **Why does Bitcoin exist?**
2. **Why does Bitcoin use so much energy?**
3. **What effect does Bitcoin have on the environment?**

For each question, a short, few-sentence answer is provided, followed by a longer three-minute answer one click away. References are included throughout, providing the reader ready access to further information.

Please contribute by proof reading the material, putting yourself in the shoes of a truck driver, dentist, mom, politician, or friend. What are the fewest, most easily digestible bits of information that can have the greatest impact?
